          <h3>Ananda</h3>
          <p>Hi! I'm Ananda, a Chemical Engineering graduate currently transitioning into the tech world. My passion for programming started during an internship at a petrochemical company, where I worked with real-world data and discovered how coding can solve complex problems. Since then, I’ve been learning Python and building projects that merge logic with analytical thinking. Outside of code, I love staying active, watching series, and relaxing by the beach.</p>
